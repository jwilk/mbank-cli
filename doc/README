CA certificate
--------------

*mbank-cli* has to verify that the server certificate has been signed by a
trusted CA (certificate authority). Unlike many other TLS clients, it
doesn't trust all the CAs whose certificates are installed system-wide, but
only **DigiCert High Assurance EV Root CA**, which
is known to be the root CA for mBank.

*mbank-cli* tries to find the certificate in the system certificate directory;
if that fails, it uses ``ca.crt`` from the same directory as the script
itself.

This procedure might not be adequate when the program is installed
system-wide on some operating systems. Packagers/administrators might want
to patch the ``get_default_ca_path()`` subroutine in such case.
