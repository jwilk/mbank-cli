    This version of mbank-cli won't attempt to log in when 2FA is enforced,
    so that people don't lock themselves out accidentally.

       to trust
    This bug is now fixed.
    https://github.com/jwilk/mbank-cli/issues/55

    and OpenSSL.

  * mbank-cli 1.0, unlike the previous versions, didn't save cookies if the
    program failed (e.g., because of an HTTP error).
    This was undesirable, and it is now fixed.

  * The “configure” command didn't expand tilde when creating directories for
    session cookie stores. This bug is now fixed.
    Be careful when removing stray “~” directories:
    $ rm -rf ./~  # correct
    $ rm -rf '~'  # also correct
    $ rm -rf ~    # WRONG! removes $HOME

mbank-cli (1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  This version of mbank-cli has been rewritten (almost) from scratch.
  It uses https://online.mbank.pl/ (or https://online.mbank.cz/, or
  https://online.mbank.sk/) as the web backend.

  The new code is available under the permissive Expat (a.k.a. MIT) license.

  The old version of mbank-cli, which uses the old interface at
  https://www.mbank.com.pl/, is still available in the legacy/ subdirectory,
  but it is no longer developed.

  Changes to the user interface:

  * The default configuration file location has changed: it's now it
    ~/.config/mbank-cli/config or $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mbank-cli/config.
    This change make it feasible to install mbank-cli system-wide.

  * Some aspects of the configuration file syntax has changed:
    + Any part of the configuration file can be now GnuPG-encrypted, not
      necessarily the whole file.
    + The encrypted parts are now required to be ASCII-armored (--armor).
    + Comments (lines starting with the “#” character) are now allowed.

  * The location of the session cookie store must now be set in the
    configuration file, or on the command line.

  * The feature of automatic re-logging when the configuration file changes
    has been removed. Users must now use different session cookie stores
    for different mBank users.

  * Slovak and Czech mBank interfaces are now supported.
    Users must set their country in the configuration file.
    https://github.com/jwilk/mbank-cli/issues/22

  * The “configure” command has been added.

  * The “cards” command has been added.

  * The “--range <date1> <date2>” option has been removed.
    Users should use “--from <date1> --to <date2>” instead.
    “now” is no longer accepted as a valid date.

  * Output format for the “future” command has been changed:
    + more information in the <recipient> field;
    + the <status> is now machine-readable.

  * Output format for the “blocked” command has been changed:
    + new field: <type>.

  * Output format for the “deposits” command has been changed:
    + removed field: <status>;
    + the <deposit-name> field is now split into <deposit-name> and
      <deposit-type>.

  * Output format for the “funds” command has changed:
    + new field: <planned-amount> (optional).

  * The “rename” and “void” have been removed.

  * New exit codes:
    + 4 for system-related errors and I/O errors;
    + 255 for internal errors.

  * The “--help” command-line option has been changed to print to stdout,
    instead of stderr.

  * New command-line option: “--version”.

  New required Perl modules:
    + Date::Format and Date::Parse;
    + HTML::HeadParser;
    + HTML::TreeBuilder;
    + IPC::Run (optionally, for password encryption);
    + JSON or JSON::PP (the latter is a core module since Perl 5.14);
    + Term::ReadLine::Gnu (only required by the “configure” command).

  Bug fixes:

  * mbank-cli 20140505 died with “only SSL_ca_path or SSL_ca_file should be
    given” when used together with IO::Socket::SSL between v1.87 and v1.972
    (inclusive), e.g. on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Trusty Tahr):
    https://github.com/jwilk/mbank-cli/issues/51
    This bug is now fixed.

  * Previous versions of mbank-cli ignored write errors (e.g. ENOSPC).
    This bug is now fixed.

  * Previous versions of mbank-cli exited with a different (non-zero) exit
    code than it was documented in some pathological circumstances.
    This bug should be now fixed.

  * The “--help” option is now documented.
