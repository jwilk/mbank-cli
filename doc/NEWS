mbank-cli (1.2.3) unstable; urgency=low

  Bug fixes:

  * Previous versions of mbank-cli did not correctly pass CA file information
    to the LWP module, which could result in the following error:
       Can't verify SSL peers without knowing which Certificate Authorities
       to trust
    This bug is now fixed.
    https://bitbucket.org/jwilk/mbank-cli/issue/55

  * Previous versions of mbank-cli could complain about missing IPC::Run,
    which was said to be needed to decrypt the configuration file, even when
    there was no encrypted data in the file. This bug is now fixed.

  * The Term::ReadLine::Gnu module is no longer required for the “configure”
    command on Windows systems, where it is not readily available.

  Documentation improvements:

  * Package dependency cheat sheet for selected free software distributions
    has been added to the README file.
    Thanks to Robert Gonciarz for the Arch Linux package list.

  * Logging in and the “funds” command have been fixed.

 -- Jakub Wilk <jwilk@jwilk.net>  Tue, 26 Aug 2014 13:01:25 +0200

mbank-cli (1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  Security improvements:

  * Current working directory (“.”) has been removed from the Perl module
    search path (@INC). Previous versions of mbank-cli could inadvertently
    load code from this directory.

    Please consult the SECURITY file for details.

  * SSLv2 and SSLv3 support has been disabled.
    The TLS protocol is now always used.

 -- Jakub Wilk <jwilk@jwilk.net>  Fri, 11 Jul 2014 18:51:56 +0200

mbank-cli (1.1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  Minor bug fixes:

  * In mbank-cli 1.0, the “configure” command would issue a warning about
    uninitialized value when it couldn't guess the language. This bug is now
    fixed.

 -- Jakub Wilk <jwilk@jwilk.net>  Thu, 03 Jul 2014 22:38:43 +0200

mbank-cli (1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  New features:

  * It is now possible to export history as CSV, HTML or PDF.

  Bug fixes and other improvements:

  * The --version option now also prints versions of some Perl modules
    (LWP::UserAgent, LWP::Protocol::https, IO::Socket::SSL Net::SSLeay)
    and OpenSSL.

  * mbank-cli 1.0, unlike the previous versions, didn't save cookies if the
    program failed (e.g., because of an HTTP error).
    This was undesirable, and it is now fixed.

  * The “configure” command didn't expand tilde when creating directories for
    session cookie stores. This bug is now fixed.
    Be careful when removing stray “~” directories:
    $ rm -rf ./~  # correct
    $ rm -rf '~'  # also correct
    $ rm -rf ~    # WRONG! removes $HOME

mbank-cli (1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  This version of mbank-cli has been rewritten (almost) from scratch.
  It uses https://online.mbank.pl/ (or https://online.mbank.cz/, or
  https://online.mbank.sk) as the web backend.

  The new code is available under the permissive Expat (a.k.a. MIT) license.

  The old version of mbank-cli, which uses the old interface at
  https://www.mbank.com.pl/, is still available in the legacy/ subdirectory,
  but it is no longer developed.

  Changes to the user interface:

  * The default configuration file location has changed: it's now it
    ~/.config/mbank-cli/config or $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mbank-cli/config.
    This change make it feasible to install mbank-cli system-wide.

  * Some aspects of the configuration file syntax has changed:
    + Any part of the configuration file can be now GnuPG-encrypted, not
      necessarily the whole file.
    + The encrypted parts are now required to be ASCII-armored (--armor).
    + Comments (lines starting with the “#” character) are now allowed.

  * The location of the session cookie store must now be set in the
    configuration file, or on the command line.

  * The feature of automatic re-logging when the configuration file changes
    has been removed. Users must now use different session cookie stores
    for different mBank users.

  * Slovak and Czech mBank interfaces are now supported.
    Users must set their country in the configuration file.
    https://bitbucket.org/jwilk/mbank-cli/issue/22

  * The “configure” command has been added.

  * The “cards” command has been added.

  * The “--range <date1> <date2>” option has been removed.
    Users should use “--from <date1> --to <date2>” instead.
    “now” is no longer accepted as a valid date.

  * Output format for the “future” command has been changed:
    + more information in the <recipient> field;
    + the <status> is now machine-readable.

  * Output format for the “blocked” command has been changed:
    + new field: <type>.

  * Output format for the “deposits” command has been changed:
    + removed field: <status>;
    + the <deposit-name> field is now split into <deposit-name> and
      <deposit-type>.

  * Output format for the “funds” command has changed:
    + new field: <planned-amount> (optional).

  * The “rename” and “void” have been removed.

  * New exit codes:
    + 4 for system-related errors and I/O errors;
    + 255 for internal errors.

  * The “--help” command-line option has been changed to print to stdout,
    instead of stderr.

  * New command-line option: “--version”.

  New required Perl modules:
    + Date::Format and Date::Parse;
    + HTML::HeadParser;
    + HTML::TreeBuilder;
    + IPC::Run (optionally, for password encryption);
    + JSON or JSON::PP (the latter is a core module since Perl 5.14);
    + Term::ReadLine::Gnu (only required by the “configure” command).

  Bug fixes:

  * mbank-cli 20140505 died with “only SSL_ca_path or SSL_ca_file should be
    given” when used together with IO::Socket::SSL between v1.87 and v1.972
    (inclusive), e.g. on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Trusty Tahr):
    https://bitbucket.org/jwilk/mbank-cli/issue/51
    This bug is now fixed.

  * Previous versions of mbank-cli ignored write errors (e.g. ENOSPC).
    This bug is now fixed.

  * Previous versions of mbank-cli exited with a different (non-zero) exit
    code than it was documented in some pathological circumstances.
    This bug should be now fixed.

  * The “--help” option is now documented.

mbank-cli (20140505) unstable; urgency=low

  Security improvements:

  * mbank-cli now uses IO::Socket::SSL (rather that Net::SSL aka
    Crypt::SSLeay) as the SSL/TLS backend.
    This change mitigates brokenness of the Net::HTTP Perl module on Ubuntu
    12.04 LTS (Precise Pangolin).
    https://bitbucket.org/jwilk/mbank-cli/issue/48

  * mbank-cli no longer trusts any certificate authorities, except for VeriSign
    Class 3 Public Primary Certification Authority.

  [ Jakub Wilk ]

  * The “withholdings” command has been renamed as “blocked”.

  [ Marcin Gryszkalis ]

  * In some environments, LWP hangs when reading the SSL stream.
    This is now mitigated by using a big buffer length hint.

mbank-cli (20120617) unstable; urgency=high

  * mbank-cli no longer creates debug files automatically by default. Use the
    --debug option to enable this feature.

  * Due to a bug in the LWP module, if the IO::Socket::SSL module was
    installed, mbank-cli did not verify the SSL certificate, making
    man-in-the-middle attacks feasible. This bug is now mitigated.

    Please consult the SECURITY file for details.

mbank-cli (20120215) unstable; urgency=medium

  * mbank-cli did not ensure that files (including some of security-sensitive
    nature, e.g. the cookie jar) are created with secure permissions. This bug
    is now fixed.

    Please consult the SECURITY file for details.

  * New command-line options have been added:
    + “-M” as an alias for “--multiple-accounts”;
    + “-A” as an alias for “--all-accounts”;
    + “--help”.

mbank-cli (20111122) unstable; urgency=low

  * Previous version of mbank-cli would silently ignore a request to select
    an account that does not exist. This is now fixed, and selecting a
    non-existent account is an error.
    https://bitbucket.org/jwilk/mbank-cli/issue/25

  * The program is now more verbose in the event of HTTP errors.

  * The Apache::ConfigFile Perl module is no longer required.
    https://bitbucket.org/jwilk/mbank-cli/issue/31

  * The --cookie-jar option has been added.

  [ Jakub Wilk ]

  * Perl v5.10 (or a later version) is now required.

  * The program is now more verbose in the event of unexpected errors.

  * Previous versions of mbank-cli died when an account had a negative amount.
    This bug is now fixed.

  [ Łukasz Indeka ]

  * The “deposits” command have been added.
    https://bitbucket.org/jwilk/mbank-cli/issue/42

  * In previous versions of mbank-cli, the “future” command could prematurely
    exit without checking all the requested accounts. This bug is now fixed.
    https://bitbucket.org/jwilk/mbank-cli/issue/39

  * In previous versions of mbank-cli, the “notices” command showed only
    customer notices. Now account notices are showed, too.
    https://bitbucket.org/jwilk/mbank-cli/issue/40

  * In previous versions of mbank-cli, the “future” and “withholdings”
    commands failed to skip accounts without corresponding menu items. This bug
    is now fixed.
