  Minor bug fixes:

  * Tilde expansion in the config file has been fixed.

mbank-cli (1.8) unstable; urgency=low

  Major bug fixes:

  * Logging in has been fixed.
    https://github.com/jwilk/mbank-cli/issues/71

  Improvements:

    but that's not implemented in mbank-cli yet.
    This version of mbank-cli won't attempt to log in when 2FA is enforced,
    so that people don't lock themselves out accidentally.

  * The --version option now also prints version of the Perl interpreter.

  Documentation improvements:

  * Descriptions of the --help and --version options have been rephrased.

mbank-cli (1.2.3) unstable; urgency=low

  Bug fixes:

  * Previous versions of mbank-cli did not correctly pass CA file information
    to the LWP module, which could result in the following error:
       Can't verify SSL peers without knowing which Certificate Authorities
       to trust
    This bug is now fixed.
    https://github.com/jwilk/mbank-cli/issues/55

    command on Windows systems, where it is not readily available.

mbank-cli (1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  Security improvements:

  * Current working directory (“.”) has been removed from the Perl module
    search path (@INC). Previous versions of mbank-cli could inadvertently
    load code from this directory.

    Please consult the SECURITY file for details.

  * SSLv2 and SSLv3 support has been disabled.
    The TLS protocol is now always used.

 -- Jakub Wilk <jwilk@jwilk.net>  Fri, 11 Jul 2014 18:51:56 +0200

mbank-cli (1.1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  Minor bug fixes:

  * In mbank-cli 1.0, the “configure” command would issue a warning about
    uninitialized value when it couldn't guess the language. This bug is now
    fixed.

 -- Jakub Wilk <jwilk@jwilk.net>  Thu, 03 Jul 2014 22:38:43 +0200

mbank-cli (1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  New features:

  * It is now possible to export history as CSV, HTML or PDF.

  Bug fixes and other improvements:

  * The --version option now also prints versions of some Perl modules
    (LWP::UserAgent, LWP::Protocol::https, IO::Socket::SSL Net::SSLeay)
    and OpenSSL.

  * mbank-cli 1.0, unlike the previous versions, didn't save cookies if the
    program failed (e.g., because of an HTTP error).
    This was undesirable, and it is now fixed.

  * The “configure” command didn't expand tilde when creating directories for
    session cookie stores. This bug is now fixed.
    Be careful when removing stray “~” directories:
    $ rm -rf ./~  # correct
    $ rm -rf '~'  # also correct
    $ rm -rf ~    # WRONG! removes $HOME

mbank-cli (1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  This version of mbank-cli has been rewritten (almost) from scratch.
  It uses https://online.mbank.pl/ (or https://online.mbank.cz/, or
  https://online.mbank.sk/) as the web backend.

  The new code is available under the permissive Expat (a.k.a. MIT) license.

  The old version of mbank-cli, which uses the old interface at
  https://www.mbank.com.pl/, is still available in the legacy/ subdirectory,
  but it is no longer developed.

  Changes to the user interface:

  * The default configuration file location has changed: it's now it
    ~/.config/mbank-cli/config or $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mbank-cli/config.
    This change make it feasible to install mbank-cli system-wide.

  * Some aspects of the configuration file syntax has changed:
    + Any part of the configuration file can be now GnuPG-encrypted, not
      necessarily the whole file.
    + The encrypted parts are now required to be ASCII-armored (--armor).
    + Comments (lines starting with the “#” character) are now allowed.

  * The location of the session cookie store must now be set in the
    configuration file, or on the command line.

  * The feature of automatic re-logging when the configuration file changes
    has been removed. Users must now use different session cookie stores
    for different mBank users.

  * Slovak and Czech mBank interfaces are now supported.
    Users must set their country in the configuration file.
    https://github.com/jwilk/mbank-cli/issues/22

  * The “configure” command has been added.

  * The “cards” command has been added.

  * The “--range <date1> <date2>” option has been removed.
    Users should use “--from <date1> --to <date2>” instead.
    “now” is no longer accepted as a valid date.

  * Output format for the “future” command has been changed:
    + more information in the <recipient> field;
    + the <status> is now machine-readable.

  * Output format for the “blocked” command has been changed:
    + new field: <type>.

  * Output format for the “deposits” command has been changed:
    + removed field: <status>;
    + the <deposit-name> field is now split into <deposit-name> and
      <deposit-type>.

  * Output format for the “funds” command has changed:
    + new field: <planned-amount> (optional).

  * The “rename” and “void” have been removed.

  * New exit codes:
    + 4 for system-related errors and I/O errors;
    + 255 for internal errors.

  * The “--help” command-line option has been changed to print to stdout,
    instead of stderr.

  * New command-line option: “--version”.

  New required Perl modules:
    + Date::Format and Date::Parse;
    + HTML::HeadParser;
    + HTML::TreeBuilder;
    + IPC::Run (optionally, for password encryption);
    + JSON or JSON::PP (the latter is a core module since Perl 5.14);
    + Term::ReadLine::Gnu (only required by the “configure” command).

  Bug fixes:

  * mbank-cli 20140505 died with “only SSL_ca_path or SSL_ca_file should be
    given” when used together with IO::Socket::SSL between v1.87 and v1.972
    (inclusive), e.g. on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Trusty Tahr):
    https://github.com/jwilk/mbank-cli/issues/51
    This bug is now fixed.

  * Previous versions of mbank-cli ignored write errors (e.g. ENOSPC).
    This bug is now fixed.

  * Previous versions of mbank-cli exited with a different (non-zero) exit
    code than it was documented in some pathological circumstances.
    This bug should be now fixed.

  * The “--help” option is now documented.

  Security improvements:

  * mbank-cli now uses IO::Socket::SSL (rather that Net::SSL aka
    Crypt::SSLeay) as the SSL/TLS backend.
    This change mitigates brokenness of the Net::HTTP Perl module on Ubuntu
    12.04 LTS (Precise Pangolin).
    https://github.com/jwilk/mbank-cli/issues/48

  * mbank-cli no longer trusts any certificate authorities, except for VeriSign
    Class 3 Public Primary Certification Authority.

mbank-cli (20120617) unstable; urgency=high

  * mbank-cli no longer creates debug files automatically by default. Use the
    --debug option to enable this feature.

  * Because of a bug in the LWP module, if the IO::Socket::SSL module was
    installed, mbank-cli did not verify the SSL certificate, making
    man-in-the-middle attacks feasible. This bug is now mitigated.

    Please consult the SECURITY file for details.

    nature, e.g. the cookie jar) are created with secure permissions. This bug
    is now fixed.

    Please consult the SECURITY file for details.

  * New command-line options have been added:
    + “-M” as an alias for “--multiple-accounts”;
    + “-A” as an alias for “--all-accounts”;
    + “--help”.

  * The program is now more verbose in the event of HTTP errors.

  * The Apache::ConfigFile Perl module is no longer required.

    customer notices. Now account notices are shown, too.
    https://github.com/jwilk/mbank-cli/issues/40

  * In previous versions of mbank-cli, the “future” and “withholdings”
